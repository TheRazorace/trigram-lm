# Simple Trigram Language Model for City Name Generation with PyTorch

This project explores the usage of basic n-gram neural networks for words generation. In particular a trigram neural network is trained on character pairs from greek city names to produce the next number in sequence. The project is an exercise task inspired by [makemore's](https://github.com/karpathy/makemore) challenges. The project is built with Pytorch.
